         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50300:33"/> and that ſhe was at liberty to marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to any other, upon this ground that ſhe was under twelve years of Age at the time of her Marriage, and that ſhe never conſented thereto after ſhe was twelve years old, nor had Carnal knowledge from the ſaid A.

                  <p>Afterwards the ſaid A. B. coming into England did ſolemnize Marriage with an Engliſh Woman, the Scottiſh Wife being then living; after which Marriage, the ſaid A. B. and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh woman for certain years Cohabited together here in England as Man and Wife, the ſaid Engliſh woman being Ignorant of the Premiſes done in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, during the time of her cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſaid A.

                  <p>It is objected on the behalf of A.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50300:34"/> of England have no Juriſdiction, nor Superiority over them: that there was no appeal or provocation from that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that it was given by the Judges of an high Courtin Scotland, from whence no appeal lyeth; and that if the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh womans Marriage ſhould be proved void here in England, the Juſtice of the Realm of Scotland, may thereby ſeem to be taxed.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is, whether the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Judges or Judge haveing Juriſdiction in the place in England where the ſaid A.

B. notwithſtanding the former objections.</p>
                  <p>We are of opinion, without any doubt, that the Eccleſiaſtical Judge haveing Juriſdiction in the place in England, where the ſaid A. B. and the ſaid Engliſh woman dwell, may, and in Juſtice is bound, at the Complaint of the ſaid Engliſh woman, to hear and

                  <p>Neither can the Juſtice of Scotland be thought to be Impeached thereby, though upon ſufficient proof made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges here in England, which was not made before the Judges in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he giveth a Sentence which may ſeem repugnant to the Sentence given in Scotland.</p>

We anſwer, that the Principal cauſe in this caſe of the Ladies, is not to reverſe or call in queſtion the ſentence given in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the principal cauſe here is, whether her Marriage made in <hi>England</hi> with Sir <hi>John,</hi> be of validity or no; for that (as we ſay) Sir <hi>John</hi> had another Wife living (viz. <hi>Iſabel Kenneda</hi>) at the time of her Marriage, without any mention to be made by the Lady of any ſentence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50300:38"/> of divorce given in <hi>Scotland;</hi> this Queſtion of Divorce is brought in but incidently by Sir <hi>John</hi> in this Cauſe, and alſo vainly and impertinently, if it can be proved that the truth is contrary to that ſentence. For that ſentence is in Law meerly void, and cannot barr the Lady for the reaſons before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for that <hi>Eccleſia</hi> was <hi>decepta</hi> in giving of that ſentence: now when a ſentence which is void in Law (and eſpecially againſt a Marriage) is called in queſtion but incidently before any <hi>Judge</hi> whatſoever though, an inferior, in a cauſe that doth principally belong to his juriſdiction: That <hi>Judge</hi> may take knowledge of, and incidently examine the validity of that ſentence, whether it were good or no, by whom and whereſoever that ſentence was given; tho he were never ſo ſuperior a <hi>Judge;</hi> not to the end to reverſe, or expreſly pronounce that ſentence to be void or not void, but as he findeth it by examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cauſe to be good or void, ſo to give ſentence accordingly, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the cauſe Principally depending
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50300:38"/> before him, without ever mentioning the erroneous ſentence in his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the ſentence given here for the Nullity of the Ladies Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage upon other matter, than was pleaded and proved before the Judges in <hi>Scotland,</hi> although the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence had been principally called in queſtion, and directly pronounced to be void, any wayes impeal the Juſtice of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ſith Judges in all Courts and cauſes, muſt Judge according to that which is alleadged and proved before them; what impeachment is it to the Juſtice of any Judge (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his ſentence be revoked, and and a contrary ſentence given by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judge) when the parties between whome the ſuite is, either cannot, or through negligence or colluſion will not alleadge or make ſuch proof before him the firſt Judge as they might, but afterwards before the ſecond Judge, good and ſufficient proof is made, a matter which falleth out every day here in <hi>England,</hi> in every Civil and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50300:39"/> Eccleſiaſtical Court upon Appeal made from one Court to another, and the like falleth out in all other Countries, and yet the former Judge whoſe ſentence is reverſed, thinketh not himſelf any whit impeached of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice thereby.</p>
                  <p>That the abſurdities which would enſue may by example more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if the Law ſhould not be as we ſay. Put this Caſe, a Widdower in the Confines of <hi>England</hi> towards <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> marrieth a Wife in a Pariſh Church publickly, in the preſence of a hundred Witneſſes, and afterwards they live together by the ſpace of a year, and have a Child; at the years end upon ſome diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they both being diſirous to be ridd, the one of the other; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>England</hi> ſueth her Husband to be divorced from him, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that at ſuch time as he married her, he had another wife living, and produceth witneſſes which prove that he had married another wife before he married her, and peradventure make
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50300:39"/> ſome probable ſhew, that that wife was living, when he married his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wife; who in truth was dead before, as the man could have plainly proved by twenty witneſſes, if he had liſted: Notwithſtanding the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being willing to be ridd of his wife, either would not plead, that his former wife was dead, or elſe would not make any proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Whereupon the woman obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſentence againſt the man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Marriage between them two, by this Colluſion and errour is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced void, from which ſentence there was no Appeal or provocation: Now within a Month after this Divorce, this man goeth into the Confines of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not Ten Miles from the place, where he and his divorced wife formerly dwelt, and there he marrieth another woman, being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the former wife and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſory Divorce, and there Cohabiteth and dwelleth with her. This woman ſhortly after underſtanding of the premiſes, and that ſhe could not be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50300:40"/> his lawful wife, but lived in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with him; deſireth before the Judge in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under whoſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction they both dwell, to be devor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from him, and to be delivered from her Adulterous living with him, and offereth to prove all the Premiſes moſt manifeſtly; were it not now a moſt abſurd and abominable thing, that this woman, ſhould have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy any where, but be inforced to live ſtill in Adultery with this man, becauſe the ſentence of divorce was given by a Judge in <hi>England,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the marriage between the man and his ſecond wife to be void, whereas it can be moſt manifeſtly and apparently proved, that the firſt wife was dead before his ſecond Marriage, and ſo the ſentence was given againſt the apparent Truth? And what impeachment of Juſtice can this be to the Judge in <hi>England,</hi> before whom it was never proved, that the mans firſt wife was dead, to have his ſentence reverſed upon new proofs made before the Judge in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                  <p>Now between the Ladies Caſe, and this Caſe there is no difference in truth of matter and point of Law, only by reaſon of the multitude of the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the nearneſs of the time and place, when and where, theſe things in this Caſe were done; the truth whereof may more eaſily and readily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than in the Ladies Cauſe it can, though with more difficulty, the caſes are all one.</p>
                  <p>If any man ſhall yet doubt, whether this cauſe can be heard and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Eccleſiaſtical Courts in <hi>England,</hi> it is deſired, that Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Councel, conſidering the Marriage was made here in <hi>England,</hi> and the Lady and Sir <hi>John</hi> do both dwell here, and by Law Sir <hi>John</hi> is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable to appear in any other place than in <hi>England,</hi> for this matter, I would tell before what Judge this matter ſhould be heard and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; for it is to be preſumed, that when two perſons live in Adultery together, and ſo in continual ſin,

                  <p>So it appeareth likewiſe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Murder of <hi>Abner</hi> by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> though it were by <hi>David</hi> reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in reſpect of great Services paſt, or reaſon of State, yet it was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.

                     </gap>ed and poyſoned himſelf; but it hath three Circumſtances which makes it grievous beyond other matters.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, That it takes a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in full peace, in God's and the King's peace; that thinks no harm, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut is comforting of Nature with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ection and Food, ſo that as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, his Table is made a Snare.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, That it is eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and eaſily conceal'd; and on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he other ſide, hardly prevented, and hardly diſcovered: For Murder by violence Princes have Guards, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50300:55"/> Private Men have Houſes, Attendants and Arms. Neither can ſuch Murder be committed, but <hi>Cum ſonitu,</hi> with ſome overt and apparent Acts, that may diſcover and trace the Offenders; but by Poyſon, the Cup it ſelf of Princes will ſcarce ſerve, in regard of many Poyſons that neither diſcolour nor diſtate: It comes upon a man when he is careleſs, and without ſuſpicion; and every day a man is within the Gates of Death.</p>
                  <p>And the laſt is, becauſe it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only the deſtruction the Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men; but of every Man, <hi>quis modo tutus erit?</hi> For many times, the Poyſon is prepared for one, and is taken by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; ſo that Men die other Men's Deaths, <hi>Concidit infoelix alieno vulnere:</hi> And it is as the Pſalmiſt calleth it, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitta nocte volans,</hi> the Arrow that fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Night, that hath no Aim nor Certainty: And therefore, if any man ſhall ſay to himſelf, Here is great talk of Impoſoynment, but I am ſure I am ſafe: For I have no Enemies, neither
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50300:55"/> have I any thing another man ſhould long for. Why, that is all one, he may ſit next him at the Table, that is meant to be Impoyſoned and pledge him of his Cup: As we may ſee in the Example of 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. That where the purpoſe was to Poyſon one man, there was Poyſon put into Barm or Yeaſt, and with that Barm, Pottage or Grewel, was made, whereby Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were poyſoned. Nay, it went into the Alms-basket likewiſe, and the Poor at the Gate were poyſoned; and therefore with great Judgment, did the Statute, made that Year, touching this Accident, make Impoyſonment High Treaſon, becauſe it tends to the Diſſolving of Humane Society: For whatſoever Offence doth ſo, is in the Nature thereof High Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Now, For the Third Degree of this particular Offence, which is, that it is Committed upon the King's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, who was out of his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and meerly in the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ection, and for whom the King and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50300:56"/> State were a kind of Reſpondent: It is a thing that aggravates the Fault much: For certainly (My Lord of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi>) let me tell you this, That Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> is the firſt Man that was Murdered in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſave the Murder of the two young Princes, by the Appointment of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Offence, now to the Proofs.</p>
                  <p>For the matter of Proofs, you may conſider, that Impoyſonment, of all Offences is moſt ſecret, even ſo ſecret, that if in all Caſes of Impoyſonment, you ſhould require Teſtimony, you ſhould as good proclaim Impunity.</p>
                  <p>Who could have impeached <hi>Livi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> by Teſtimony, for the poyſoning of the Figgs upon the Tree, which her Huſband was wont to gather with his own Hands? Who could have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached <hi>Paraſetis</hi> for the poyſoning of the one ſide of the Knife ſhe carried with her, and keeping the other ſide clean; ſo that her ſelf did eat of the ſame Piece of Meat that they did, whom ſhe did impoyſon.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:50300:56"/>
                  <p>Theſe Caſes are infinite, and need not to be ſpoken of the Secrecy of Impoyſonment; but wiſe men muſt take upon them, in theſe Secret Caſes, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Spirit, that, when there could be no Witneſſes, collected the Act by the Affection; but yet we are not at our Cauſe, for that which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are to try, is not the Act of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſonment; for that is done to your Hands: All the World by Law is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to ſay, that <hi>Overbury</hi> was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by <hi>Weſton;</hi> but the queſtion before you, is of the Procurement on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as the Law termeth it, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary before the Fact; which abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, is no more, but to do, or uſe any Act or Means which may aid, or conduce to the Impoyſonment.</p>
                  <p>So that it is not the buying, nor the making of the Poyſon, nor the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, nor confecting, nor commixing of it, or the giving, or ſending, or laying of the Poyſon that did the only Acts that do amount unto the Abettment; but if there be any other Act or Means done or uſed, to give opportunity of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50300:57"/> Impoyſonment, or to facilitate the Execution of it, or to ſtop or divert any Impediments that might hinder it, and that it be with an intention to accompliſh and atchieve the Impoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment: All theſe are Abettments, and Acceſſaries before the Fact: As for Example, if there be a Conſpiracy to murder a man, as he journeyeth on the way by Invitation, or by colour of ſome Buſineſs; and another taketh upon him to diſſuade ſome Friends of his Company, that he is not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make his Defence; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath a part, to hold him in talk till the firſt Blow be given. All theſe, My Lords, without Scruple, are Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to the Murder, although none of them give the Blow, nor aſſiſt to give the Blow.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, He is not the Hunter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that lets ſlip the Dog upon the Deer, but he that lodgeth him, and hunts him out, or ſets a Train or Trap for him, that he cannot eſcape, or the like; but this My Lords, little need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this Caſe: For ſuch a Chain of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50300:57"/> Acts of Impoyſonment as this, I think was never heard or ſeen. And thus much of the Nature of the Proofs.</p>
                  <p>To deſcend to the Proofs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I ſhall keep this Courſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will make a Narration of the Fact it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will break and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the Proofs, as they concern the Priſoner, and,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, According to the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, I will produce them and read them, to uſe them, ſo that there is nothing that I ſhall ſay, but your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſhall have Three Thoughts or Cogitations to anſwer it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When I open it, you may take your Aim.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When I diſtribute it, you may prepare your Anſwers without Confuſion, and,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, When I produce the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, or the Examinations themſelves, you may again ruminate, and read viſe to make your Defence.</p>
                  <p>And this I do, becauſe your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Underſtanding may not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50300:58"/> or over-laden with length of Evidence, or with Confuſion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Nay more, when your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſhall make your Anſwer in your time, I will put you in mind, where Cauſe ſhall be, of your omiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Therefore Sir <hi>Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> for a time, was known to have great Intereſt and ſtrait friendſhip with my Lord of <hi>Somerſet</hi> both in his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Fortunes, and after, inſomuch, that he was a kind of Oracle of Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto him; and if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his own Vaunt, (being indeed of an Inſolent and Thraſonical Diſpoſition) he took upon him, that the Fortunes, Reputation and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this Gentleman (who is well known to have an able Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) proceeded from his Company and Counſel; and this Friendſhip reſted not only in Converſation, and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at Court, but likewiſe in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Secrets of State: For my Lord of <hi>Somerſet</hi> exerciſing at that time, by his Majeſties ſpecial Favour and Truſt, the Office of Secretary, did

Pacquets were ſent, ſometimes opened by my Lord, ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken unto <hi>Overbury,</hi> who peruſed them, copied them, regiſtred them, made Table-talk of them, as they thought good; ſo I will undertake, the time was, when <hi>Overbury</hi> knew more of the Secrets of the State, than the Council-Table did. Nay, they were grown to ſuch Inwardneſs, as they made a Play of all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves; ſo as they had Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Jurgons for the King and Queen, and Great Men of the Realm.

                  <p>That was too weak, and they were ſo far from giving way to it, as they croſſed it; there reſted but two ways of Quarrel, Aſſault and Poyſon: For that of Aſſault, after ſome Propoſition and Attempt, they paſſed from it, as a thing too open and ſubject to more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Plot, it was concluded, that he ſhould be deſign'd to ſome Honourable Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ployment in Foreign Parts, and ſhould under-hand by my Lord of <hi>Somerſet</hi> be encouraged to refuſe it; and ſo, up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on Contempt, he ſhould be laid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Tower, and then they thought he ſhould be cloſe enough and Death ſhould be his Bail; yet were they not at their End: For they conſidered, that if there were not a fit Lieutenant of the Tower for their purpoſe, and likewiſe a fit Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper of <hi>Overbury,</hi> Firſt, They ſhould meet with many Impediments in the giving and exhibiting of the Poyſon. Secondly, They ſhould be expoſed to Note and Obſervation, that might diſcover them. And Thirdly, <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> in the mean time might write cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and furious Letters to his Friends, and ſo all might be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And therefore the next Link of the Chain, was to diſplace the then

Then when they had this poor Gentleman in the Tower, cloſe Priſoner, where he could not eſcape, nor ſtir, where he could not feed but by their Hands, where he could not ſpeak nor write, but through their Trunks; then was the time to act the laſt Day of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</p>

                  <p>And Laſtly, Becauſe all this asked time, Courſes were taken by <hi>Somerſet</hi> both to divert all the true means of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Delivery, and to entertain him with continual Letters, partly with Hopes and Proteſtations for his Delivery, and partly with other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Negations: ſomewhat like ſome kind of Perſons, which keep in a Tale of Fortune-telling, when they have a Felonious Intent to pick their Pockets and Purſes. And this is the true Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Act, which I have ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily recited.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Diſtribution of the Proofs, there are four Heads to prove you guilty, whereof two are prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Impoyſonment; the Third is preſent, and the Fourth is following or ſubſequent: For it is in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50300:62"/> Proofs, as it is in Lights, there is a direct Light, and there is a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Light, and a double Light.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Head or Proof thereof is, that there was a Root of Bitterneſs, a Mortal Malice or Hatred mixed, with a deep and bottomleſs Miſchief, that you had to Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is, That you were the Principal Actors, and had your Hand in all thoſe Acts which did conduce to the Impoyſonment, and gave Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to effect it, without which, the Impoyſonment could never have been, and which could ſeem to tend to no other end but the Impoyſonment.</p>
                  <p>The Third is, That your Hand was in the very Impoyſonment it ſelf, that you did direct Poyſon, and that you did deliver Poyſon, and that you did continually hearken to the Succeſs of the Impoyſonment, and that you ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed it on, and called for a Diſpatch, when you thought it lingred.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, That you did all things after the Impoyſonment, which may detect a guilty Conſcience for the ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50300:63"/> of it, and the avoiding of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for it, which can be but of three Kinds.</p>
                  <p>That you ſuppreſſed as much as in you was, Teſtimony, that you did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, deſtroy, clip and miſdate all Writings that might give light to the Impoyſonment; and you did fly to the Altar of Guiltineſs, which is a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Murder, and a Pardon for your ſelf, and not for your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In this, my Lords, I convert my Speech unto you, becauſe I would have you alter the points of your Charge, and ſo make your Defence the better: And two of theſe Heads I have taken to my ſelf, and left the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King's two Serjeants.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt main part, which is the Mortal Malice coupled with Fear that was in you to Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> altho' you did palliate it with a great deal of Hypocriſie and Diſſimulation, even to the very end: I will prove it, my Lord Steward, the Root of this Hate, was that which coſt many a Man's Life, that is, fear of diſcovering Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50300:63"/> I ſay, of Secrets of a dangerous and high Nature; wherein the Courſe that I will hold ſhall be this.</p>
                  <p>I will ſhew that a Breach and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice was betwixt my Lord and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and that it burſt forth into vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Threats and Menaces on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That theſe Secrets were not of a Light, but of an High Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: I will give you the Elevation of the Pole; they were ſuch as my Lord of <hi>Somerſet</hi> had made a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow, that <hi>Overbury</hi> ſhould never live in Court nor Country; that he had likewiſe opened ſo far, that either he or himſelf muſt die for it; and of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbury</hi>'s part, he had threatned, my Lord, that whether he did live or die, my Lord's Shame ſhould never die; but that he would leave him the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> And again, it was too late for the matter; for the Bargain of the Match was then made and paſt: And if it had been no more than to remove <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> from diſturbing the Match, it had been an eaſie matter to have landed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Overbury;</hi> for which they had a fair way, but that would not ſerve.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, <hi>periculum periculo vinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> to go ſo far as an Impoyſonment, muſt have a deeper Malice than Flaſhes; for the Cauſe muſt have a Proportion in the Effect.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:50300:64"/>
                  <p>For the next General Head or Proof, which conſiſts in the Acts preparatory, or middle Acts; they are in eight ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Points of the Compaſs, as I may term them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There were divers Devices and Projects to ſet <hi>Overbury's</hi> Head on Work to diſpatch him and overthow him, plotted between the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> before they fell upon the Impoiſonment: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before men fix upon a Courſe of Miſchief, there will be ſome Reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but die he muſt one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That my Lord of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> was principal Practicer, I muſt ſpeak it in a moſt perfidious manner, to ſet a Trap and Train for <hi>Overbury,</hi> to get him into the Tower, without which they durſt not attempt the Impoyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the placing of the Lieutenant <hi>Yelvis,</hi> one of the Impoyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was done by my Lord of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:50300:65"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the placing of <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> the Underkeeper, who was the principal Impoyſoner, and the diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Cary;</hi> and the doing all this within the ſpace of fifteen Days after <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Commitment, was by the Means and Countenance of my Lord of <hi>Somerſet;</hi> and theſe were the Active Inſtruments of the Impoyſonment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> And this was a buſineſs the Ladies Power could not reach unto.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That becauſe there muſt be a Cauſe of this Tragedy to be Acted, and chiefly, becauſe they would not have the Poyſons work upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and for that the Strength of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbury</hi>'s Nature, on the very Cuſtom of receiving the Poyſons into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, did overcome the Poyſons, that they wrought not ſo faſt; therefore <hi>Overbury</hi> muſt be held in the Tower, as well as he was laid in; and as my Lord of <hi>Somerſet</hi> got him into the Trap, ſo he keeps him in, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him with continual hope of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but diverted all the true and effectual Means of his Liberty, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50300:65"/> makes light of his Sickneſs and Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
                  <p>6. That not only the Plot of getting <hi>Overbury</hi> into the Tower, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to hold and keep him there, but the ſtrange manner of the cloſe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, being in but for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, was by the Device and Means of my Lord of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who denied his Father to ſee him, denied his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that offered to be ſhut up cloſe Priſoners with him; and in effect hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it ſo, that he made him cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to all his Friends, and expoſed to all his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That all the Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lady received from time to time, from the Lieutenant or <hi>Weſton,</hi> touching <hi>Overbury</hi>'s State of Body and Health, were ever ſent nigh to the Court though it were in Progreſs, and that from my Lady, ſuch a Thirſt and Liſtening he had to hear that he was diſpatched.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That there was a continual Negotiation to ſet <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Head on Work, that he ſhould make ſome to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50300:66"/> clear the Honour of the Lady, and that he ſhould be a good Inſtrument towards her and her Friends; all which was but Entertainment: For your Lordſhips ſhall ſee divers of my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Letters, (whoſe Hand was deep in this Buſineſs) written, I muſt ſay in dark words and Clauſes, that there was one thing pretended, and another thing intended; that there was a real Charge, and ſomewhat not real, a main Drift and Diſſimulatien: Nay further, there be ſome Paſſages which the Peers in their Wiſdoms will diſcern, to point directly at the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment.</p>

               <head type="sub">From the Original, written by Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coke</hi>'s (then Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) own Hand.</head>
               <p>MY Maſter's known Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and conſtant Favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, attended with Confidence in my own Faith and Innocency, may make it ſeem both needleſs and unfit by any Defence, to ſhew reſpect to a <hi>Libellous Information,</hi> which reflecteth wholly upon the Author's Diſhonour: For who will not abhor this deplored Art of Calumniating boldly? Becauſe no Aſperſion (how falſe ſoever) can
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50300:71"/> be waſh'd off ſo clean, but ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colouring will remain.</p>
               <p>Beſides, tho' Conſpiracy be a Work of Darkneſs, hardly to be cleared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in it, Suſpitions go for Proof; yet my Youth and manner of Life, and even that Character of Irregular Freedom which the Accuſers ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, will, by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s known Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, acquit me thereof: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if my Perſonal Diſgrace or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger were the Marks they aim at, I would ſtand or fall by his Knowledge of me, who hath made me what I am; and hath both Right and Power to unmake me at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But as that Wife King well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that when his Brother demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> he ſought not her but the Kingdom; ſo his Majeſties piercing Judgment will diſcover my Name to be the Mask, Himſelf, his Royal Children, and his Kingdomes to be the true Subjects of this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Complaint. And tho' the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars thereof are forged, partly by Jeſuites and their Factions at Home,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50300:71"/> and partly by corrupt Miniſters and Emiſſaries Abroad; yet the Workmen that manage them are Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, of whoſe Offices and Sway amongſt us, we already feel the ſmart, and have cauſe to prevent the Danger that may enſue: eſpecially conſidering, they are Engines of that affected Monarchy, which hath inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it ſelf by Negotiations, more than by Arms: And which by advantage of late Treaties, hath not lately inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Patrimonies of his Majeſties Children, but procured ſuch Liberty and Connivance with his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as they ſuppoſed would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Rebellion, not to be appeaſed without the help of their Arms.</p>
               <p>And ſince their Deſigns (by God's Providence) are now brought to light, what could Malice it ſelf have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more pernicious than by ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Breaches, fury-like to ſtir Jealouſies betwixt the King, his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and moſt obliged Servants; and which is more horrible, betwixt the Bark and the Tree: Nay, betwixt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50300:72"/> the Tree it ſelf and all the Branches thereof. Now in reſpect of theſe Conſequences, altho' my Perſon be of no Conſideration, and happily, by ſaying nothing, or doing eaſie Offices, might redeem their Diſpleaſure: Yet where my Duty is ſo deeply engaged, I, in my Heart, cannot hold; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for their Intereſts for whom by my humble thankfulneſs and Faith, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the chief Hopes and Fruits of my Life; yet ſo as the World ſhall bear me Witneſs, I plead my Cauſe, the demonſtration that his Majeſty commanded theſe Informations; firſt to be told, and then to be written in the Letters they alledge, whereby they excuſe themſelves of being Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, as of a Practiſe too baſe for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Rank. But the Truth redoundeth only to his Majeſties Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For as in their Treaties, they ever drew us on by making us rich and happy in general Promiſes, ſo now by ſuch general contriving of ſtrange Conſpiracies and Plots among our ſelves, they endeavour to divert
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50300:72"/> us from any further Diſcovery or Prevention of theirs.</p>
               <p>And this his Majeſty perceiving, Firſt preſſed them to Particulars, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Verbal Charges uncertain, and ſubject to Inlargment, or Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, at the Peoples Pleaſure: he then commanded them to be written ſo as now they are fixed, and no more in their Power; but may be examined and judged by all men of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to whoſe Conſtruction and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I willingly ſubmit both them and my Anſwer. For what can be the Danger, When in the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of my Accuſation they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the matters objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, are not ſuch as may be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Judicial Proofs? And muſt his Majeſty then take them merely upon Truſt? Indeed Ambaſſadors have an Honourable Truſt for their Maſters Affairs; and if they obtain a like Truſt with thoſe Princes to whom they are imployed; what will they not perſuade? Shall not the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Palatinate, the Marriage
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50300:73"/> and Diſpenſation, and the Portion be made Articles to be added to our Creed? But the Original Sin and Root of all Treaſons and Offences laid to my Charge is, that by eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit in <hi>Spain,</hi> mine Eyes have been opened to diſcover the Evil as well as the Good; and ſo to truſt them no further than they deſerve.</p>
               <p>And yet I will not here take them too ſhort, for they ſay they have Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; but ſuch as for fear of my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do withdraw themſelves; ſuch as dare not ſpeak and deliver their minds, though commanded by the King; and though thereby they ſuffer the beſt King in the World to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Extremities; and ſuch as neither will nor dare ſpeak, if firſt they be not freed from Jealouſie and Fear, yet theſe they pronounce to be his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Moſt Faithful Subjects. Surely of our Faith they cannot be which holdeth them Traytors, Faithleſs and Perjured, that prefer not the Safety, and Honour of their Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before the Fear and Reſpect of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50300:73"/> any perſon whomſoever: And if this Fear proveth them to be of their Faith, how can they think, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Ambaſſador's Houſe, to be ſo heinous, a matter as here is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended? Doth not all the World know the Liberty they give; and which, as Papiſts, have taken beyond Examples in this kind? They are not then Maſs-Papiſts, but perhaps of Higher Rank, having Place and Acceſs to deliver their Minds to the King if they durſt.</p>
               <p>And ſuch only are worthy their Nomination, and his Majeſties Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Matters of this Weight. His Majeſty therefore, to go beyond Craft and Malice, hath, in his Royal Wiſdom and Juſtice, by a new Example, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted even the great men, which by their ordinary Acceſs might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this Scandal, to be examined upon Oath. And what the Accuſers gained thereby, let them boaſt, and ſhew reaſon (if they can) why the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done me in their Anſwer, ſhould not give both his Majeſty and the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50300:74"/> World Satisfaction on my behalf; and why they themſelves, (till they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce other Authors) ſhould not be reputed the Inventors of theſe Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Reports? And whereas they ſay in in the end, that there wanteth not means to free theſe honeſt Men (as they call them) from Fear and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt: Indeed the Inquiſition of <hi>Spain</hi> is ſaid to have found the way, Firſt to Impriſon, and keep cloſe, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Accuſers, if ſuch be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found, then to force men by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities to be Accuſers of themſelves. But howſoever this way hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Exterminate from their Country that which they call Hereſie, and we True Religion: Yet conſidering no other Nation approveth it as Lawful and Juſt, I hope I ſhall not be the firſt Example of planting it amongſt us.</p>
               <p>But they ſay further, though his Subjects durſt not, yet the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors would have informed his Majeſty againſt me, if any free Audience could in my Abſence have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And why in my Abſence?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50300:74"/> Or why ſhould not the Ambaſſador of ſo Great a King accuſe me to my Face? Or how could they without Diſhonour to their Maſter and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, traduce me behind my Back? And why did my Induſtrious ſeeking to be preſent, argue my Fear and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Conſcience, and not rather an aſſured Confidence in my Truth? But this (ſay they) is not to be done, ſave only where the King is of ſmall Experience or under Age, or of no Judgment, and the Favorite wiſe, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, and of great Judgment and Experience; and not in this Caſe where every thing is contrary. Whereunto I anſwer, that I am moſt willing to lay my Honour at my Maſter's Feet in the Duſt; ſo as the World be ſenſible with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Indignation of this Jeſuit-ſchool-wit that by the Figure of Oppoſing, my Maſter to me, and him to other Princes, ſeemingly flattereth, really ſtaineth the Honour both of our and their Kings.</p>
               <p>For ours, the Freedom of Acceſs, Diſcourſe, Converſation and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment he giveth to all Ambaſſadors,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50300:75"/> is ſuch a Singular Glory to all his Roy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al Abilities, and Gracious Diſpoſition as no Favourite can Eclipſe, no Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per can blemiſh: And for theirs, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Spain:</hi> And muſt we therefore apply the Uſe and Honour of their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, to the diſabling of their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As unexperienced and precipitate as they make me, I know my Duty bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and do well underſtand, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites do then vaniſh, when their Maſters Greatneſs by them becometh leſs: Yet this is not all; for they tell us, that his Majeſty is Moſt Wiſe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Great Experience, and the beſt King in the World. And this they repeat, that with the Sugar of theſe Epithites they may cover their Bitter Pills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they forbear not withal to ſay, that he ſuffereth a Precipitate Novice to be too Powerful with him, that his Moſt Faithful Subjects dare not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Minds unto him: And that thereby he is brought into Great
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50300:75"/> Extremities, and doth many unfit things.</p>
               <p>And are theſe Figures to be uſed to Princes? Did the Miniſters of Great Monarchs thus by Deeds confute Words? And am I the Cat they whip, to make the King believe I draw him over the Pool? This ſavoureth not of that Modeſty which I may challenge to my ſelf, if I acknowledge thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects they charge me withal. And yet when they have laid me as low as they pleaſe, they ſhall find my weak Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſupported ſufficiently with my Maſter's Wiſdom: And for my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, though I may aſſume ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what by ſo many Years Truſt and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment under him; yet ſomewhat more I have learnt in <hi>Spain,</hi> to be put in practiſe when my Service ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in thoſe Parts. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I confeſs ingeniouſly, that what I do amiſs, proceedeth from my own Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation and Error. And what I do well, is by my Maſter's Wiſdom and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for which I owe him more, than for his great Favour, and the Fortunes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50300:76"/> I enjoy. But for theſe Actions, which under the Veil of my Name, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make odious to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I profeſs, that as they are really his Majeſties or the Princes; ſo they are well approved by the chiefeſt and beſt part of Chriſtendom, as tending to the Honour of his Wiſdom, the Good of the Prince, the Happineſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the People, and the Settling of this State in their Poſterity for ever.</p>
               <p>For the better clearing whereof, I will proceed to a particular Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Extremities to which they ſay his Majeſty is now brought.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is the Enmity of their moſt powerful King by my induſtrious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement. And why his Enmity? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Treaties are diſſolved. And is this a neceſſary Conſequence, that either we muſt ſuffer them by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to undermine and compaſs all their ends, or elſe undergo their Enmity, and (as they afterwards interpret it) a moſt cruel War? And is not this a Proclamation to all the World, that they aſpire to ſuch an abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50300:76"/> as ſo many Books Stories, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and the general Complaints of all Princes and States have long char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them with? And indeed, as the true Character of their Religion is Perſecution and Blood, ſo the true mark of their Empire is Oppreſſion and War: Yet connot theſe Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings amuſe or diſturb the Religious and peaceable Reſolutions of our King, Prince and People. They hate War, they pray againſt it, they love Peace, they proſper by it; and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by all means to preſerve it: But if they be aſſailed, they cannot but remember how God's Mighty Hand, by a Late Queen of peace, brought down her Enemies greatneſs and pride, to acknowledge the Sovereignty of a deſpiſed people, which ever ſince hath reſiſted and ballanced their power: And therefore they cannot but hope, that the ſame Arm by a King of peace, ſhall in the end prevail with them to entertain a ſafe peace upon more equal Terms; and then all men ſhall have cauſe to applaud that Wiſdom and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50300:77"/> Reſolution which theſe men are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with, and therefore ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
               <p>The next Extremity they complain of is the calling of a Parliament by my procurement, and to my ends, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Honour they do me is more than I am capable of. And for the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie they would raiſe of making my ſelf Head of that Council, or the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> Faction; my Maſter will laugh at it, and thereby know they want probable Matter to object againſt my Faith; which when they queſtion, they aſſail me in my Strength, and ſhall find my Deeds as ready and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Juſtifications as my Words. But it is not my Faith or Aſpiring, they here would bring in doubt; they have a further Strain: For as before they made my Name a Fume to diſquiet the Head; now they make it a Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to carry Infection into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>For, What is the Parliament, but the Body of the Kingdom? And why do they ſtain it with the hateful Name
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50300:77"/> of <hi>Puritan,</hi> but to make it odious to the King? Indeed ſuch Names help the Jeſuits in Diſputes of Religion, when they are driven from all real Defences; and would they practice this deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And by what Inſpection could they know more than the Prince? Except thoſe innocent Letters were like indented Pictures, which ſhew to one's view a fair, and to another's a foul Face? Is it not ſtrange, that Malice it ſelf is not ſatiated with the Diſtreſſes of thoſe Worthy Princes, except it bereave them not only of neceſſary Support and Relief; but alſo of that Love and good Opinion whereby they muſt ſubſiſt? And to what other End tendeth that careful Admonition to the King, to takeheed both to himſelf and to the Prince? My Precipitation, my Ambition and my Popularity, are but the Fringe and Shadow: The ſupplanting of theſe Princes the Diverſion of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their Father and Brother, the bereaving them of all Aſſiſtance and Comfort; and finally, the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of all our Affairs, are the true
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50300:82"/> Ends of theſe Fore-warnings, and falſe pretended Fears: For my Ambition and Popularity, how appeared it in Parliament? by caſting (ſay they) all Odious Matters upon the King; and arrogating the thanks of all things acceptable to my ſelf, and by the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle given me to be Redeemer of my Country: Such Generalities are ever the Subterfuges of deceit, But let them inſtance in any Particular, either of odious Matter there propounded, and caſt upon the King, or of plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereof all the Honour was not his; and that with greater Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reverence and Thankfulneſs, than in former Parliaments hath been ſeen. For the Title, it is true, that by our Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> we were brought out of Darkneſs into Light; and the Diſcovery of former Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, and future Dangers of the Treaties was applauded in Parliament, as no leſs than a Work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the State. But therein, all that I aſſumed, or was attributed to me, was the Happineſs to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50300:82"/> the Prince's Government, whoſe Wiſdom in diſcovering the Inſincerity of their Pretences, in refuſing thoſe things which were utterly inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in yielding to ſuch, as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, were corrigible afterwards; and in qualifying the reſt to a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſtruction, was the only means of redeeming our Safety, and ſettling our Affairs. And for his Majeſty, who hath heard of his Name that can doubt that his deep Underſtanding and Experience was the true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from which all our Directions did proceed?</p>
               <p>Then how can I be charged with Envy againſt the great Good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, and eſpecially of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain?</hi> When all the World ſhall underſtand, that the King and Prince under God, and by his Bleſſings, are the chief means to reſcue all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, eſpecially <hi>England,</hi> from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation of that pretended Empire, which they call the Good; but is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Bondage and Miſery of both—Having thus ſerved their Turns with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50300:83"/> my Name againſt his Majeſty, againſt the Prince, againſt the Parliament, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Royal Daughter, and her Race; who could think it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Malice could ſtrain higher? Yet their Maſter-piece is behind. And whereas their former Suggeſtions were grounded upon, they ſay here, They know in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſuch Shaddows of Teſtimonies at large: For this they now hatch, becauſe it is monſtrous in it ſelf; and hath nothing in Being, poſſible to ground upon. They lay a ſtrange Foundation upon a bare Pretence, that many ſpeak ominouſly fearing the worſt; but withal, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Majeſties Wiſdom cannot be wrought upon by Popular Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, they ſay farther, that he that told it, did the Office of a good Man, both to God, his Majeſty and the Prince. Yet ſurely, this was not the good Man of <hi>David,</hi> that imagineth no Evil, and telleth no Untruth; but ſuch an one as St. <hi>John</hi> calleth the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the Brethren, or as <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> that told the King, how <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:50300:83"/> his Son-in-law, and the Prieſt of <hi>Abimelech</hi> had conſpired againſt him: For what ſaith this good man? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, that the Puritans (if they do deſire a King, which willingly they do not) do not at all deſire the Moſt Illuſtrious Prince, but the Prince Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine, whoſe Scout <hi>Mansfield</hi> is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pretends: And leſt any man might imagine, that they mean Factious Puritans, which are now no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Number amongſt us: In the next Clauſe, for Explanation, they menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fury of the Parliament; and ſoon after, the Reproach of the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. But why then do they not call us by the old name of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants? Becauſe that is now a Name of too much allay, and could have bred no diſtaſte in the King; but knowing what he ſuffered by Puritans elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to make the whole Nation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious both to King and Prince, they turn us Puritans all at once, though that Faction be more hated and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt amongſt us, than in all the World beſides. And what is then our Ruin?</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:50300:84"/>
               <p>Firſt, In General, That we are not willing to be ſubject unto Kings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Particular, That we deſire not the Prince, but the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, Let them know, that theſe Kingdoms of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> are beyond Compariſon more Antient than the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain;</hi> and yet no Story reputeth, that they ever had or deſired, or were capable of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment but Regal: And the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion we profeſs, binds our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more firmly to obey, honour, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and defend our Kings againſt all hteir Enemies than Popiſh Religion can do: And this they will find to be true when they attempt ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us,</p>
               <p>For the Second, I will not be ſo vain, as to diſcourſe of the Prince, or his Intereſt in the good Opinion of the People. This only I ſay for his Religion, they made him a Confeſſor in <hi>Spain,</hi> as their Faction long ſince made his Royal Father in his Honor a Martyr: And for his Carriage, he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50300:84"/> converſeth with us daily, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us much better than any ſtranger can; and therefore we truſt his own Experience and good Opinion of us, againſt all they can ſuggeſt. And for the Prince Palatine, we love his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which we were extracted; and we love his Religion, which was the Ground of the Alliance with him; and we much eſteem that Noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by whom he participateth, with that Duty and Affection which from the King, as the Root, in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion diſperſeth it ſelf in all the Branches; yet ſo, as whenſoever they ſhall divide from the Head, or the Body, they cannot but know, that their Moiſture will dry up. And for Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> it is worth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, how they labour to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and divert that Fear of him which they cannot have for us, but indeed for themſelves; leaſt he, who hath already ſo troubled them in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> ſhould diſturb them elſewhere. Now whereas they conjure King and Prince, to foreſee the Vengeance of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50300:85"/> God, provoked by my Practiſes, and the Fury of Parliament, for Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Libels againſt the Honour of <hi>Spain:</hi> How much more Cauſe have they both, and we all, to conſider and praiſe God's Miraculous Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in preſerving their Perſons, and bleſſing their Endeavours in ſo happy a Diſcovery and Prevention of thoſe Dangers, which the Treaties would have brought upon our Religion and State? And thereby reſt aſſured, that he will ſtill bleſs where they curſe, and eſtabliſh the Scepters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of his Faith, and in powring his Vengeance upon the Beaſt, and the Enemies of his Truth. And if the Teſtimonies publiſhed againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> and believed in Parliament, were not true, why do they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them and ſatisfie them, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the World? And for thoſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ignominious Libels they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why can they not be read, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ignominy to our Nation, as well as <hi>Paſquin</hi>'s in <hi>Rome,</hi> and like Libels in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50300:85"/> with their Reproach? Eſpecially conſidering, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of all People, are moſt purſued with Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this kind, ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all other, do puniſh Libels with moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and Rigour.</p>
               <p>But that which followeth, is yet more remarkable: It is apparent (ſay they) that the League is broken, and Hiſtories will witneſs it: Surely thoſe Hiſtories muſt be of their Writing; for true hiſtories cannot record any breach on our part. The Treaties are indeed diſſolved. Firſt, materially by them, and then formally by us. But are thoſe Treaties any Articles of the League? Or is it in the Power of any Subject (be he never ſo willful) to break the Leagues of Princes without due Juſtice demanded and refuſed? But now the Ambaſſadors, publick Miniſters of State, have made ſuch Declaration: How far that extendeth his Majeſty may conſider; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Firſt, Concerning my Carriage of the Negotiation in <hi>Spain:</hi> And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, For my Perſonal Actions and Behaviour.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Buſineſs, becauſe greater Perſons are ſtill involved in their Cenſure, they make their way (as Poets do in Tragedies) by raiſing me as a Ghoſt, to poſſeſs King and Prince, and to terrifie all men that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my Deſigns. Surely, I think, they ſmiled, when they writ this paſſage:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50300:87"/> For they cannot think me ſo predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, nor ſo terrible a Creature. But to ſatisfie the World in thoſe four firſt Queſtions which contain the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all the Buſineſs in <hi>Spain;</hi> I will briefly as I can, repeat the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings which have been related in Parliament more at large, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Letters and Records; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, not only by the moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men they ſpeak of, but by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and unanimons Votes, from which no one did diſſent.</p>
               <p>But Firſt, having the honour to be of my Maſter's inward Council in theſe things, I muſt teſtifie to the Renown of his Wiſdom, and eſpecially of his Goodneſs; that as in the Marriage of his Daughter, his chief Intention was to ſettle and corroborate the Party of our Religion where it is moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſo by the Marriage of his Son, in ſome powerful Houſe of the other Religion, he ſought not only the ſtrengthening and aſſuring is own Peace and Succeſſion, but the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Good of all Chriſtendome: and a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50300:88"/> means to qualifie by the Cooperation of thoſe Princes, the Spiritual Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, whereby, in time, ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accord in the Differences of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might be made. From theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and that ſpecial Reſpect and Affection his Majeſty ever bore to the moſt Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the former motion for the Marriage of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (who is with God) did proceed. But that brake (as the World knoweth) by incongruous Propoſitions on either part. Since then an <hi>Overture</hi> being entertain'd in <hi>France</hi> for Prince <hi>Charles</hi> that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And Notice thereof being gotten in <hi>Spain,</hi> both the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and their Ambaſſador the now Count <hi>Gondomer,</hi> were imploy'd to divert that Match, by negotiating a Second Treatie for a Daughter of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And that with ſuch Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the accommodating of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer differences of Religion and State, and for ſo great a Portion, and with ſo Royal Conditions, that his Majeſty therupon was perſuaded to give Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50300:88"/> to that purpoſe, to his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in <hi>Spain;</hi> wherupon they proceeded, not only to Treat and to Article, but even to the granting of Commiſſions, and powers to contract: And all this while, no Stop, no Difficulty was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, which they made not light and eaſie to paſs over: Nay, the Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſo potent, that the Wars of <hi>Bohemia</hi> then happening, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that their Forces ſhould not attempt the Palatinate, his Majeſty forbore to aſſiſt or countenance his own Son-in-law: And thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the loſs of the Battle of <hi>Prague,</hi> the diſbanding of the Union; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of reſtoring, the Conqueſt of that Country, and the diſpoſing of the Electorate to another Prince: and in the mean time to add Scorn to Loſs, his Majeſty was drawn with great Charge, to ſend Ambaſſadors to <hi>Prague,</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to <hi>Heidelbergh,</hi> to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> to mediate for Truce, for Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Arms, or for Peace, as beſt ſuited for their Advantage; whilſt by croſs Letters, or ſecret Intelligences,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50300:89"/> they cooled or kindled their promiſed Mediation, and kept us ſtill in appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and hope, by our own Miniſters and their aſſuring us of the Match. At length the Treaty at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> gave the firſt Jealouſie, that their Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were indirect. And thereupon his Majeſty ſent <hi>Porter</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> with a peremptory Direction to return in ten days; and to bring expreſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the King, whether, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe made by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, he would cauſe the Palatinate to be reſtored: Or if by Mediation, he could not prevail, whether he would joyn in Arms to recover it by force; or at leaſt, give Paſſage for the King's Forces thither. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn brought by <hi>Porter,</hi> was cold and unſatisfactory; and withal delayed longer than here was expected: And this moved the Prince more ſeriouſly to conſider, how by holding us in Treaty, they had gotten full Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Siſters Eſtates; they had ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and broken moſt of our Allies; they would in ſhort time eat out our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50300:89"/> Neighbours; And every day gained upon us in matter of Religion.</p>
               <p>And this wrought in him that Princ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Heroical Reſolution, to go in perſon into <hi>Spain,</hi> either with Honour and Contentment of both Nations to conſummate that Marriage which his Heart was ſo conſtantly ſet upon; or elſe to free both his Father and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from being any longer abuſed with delays. This Counſel his Highneſs was pleaſed to communicate with me, and to make me his Servant to break it to the King, which I did accordingly. And His Majeſty after long and deep deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, was contented to give way, and commanded me to wait upon him in his Journey. So we undertook it with that Adventure, Charge, Danger, and Travel both of Body and Mind, which I need not ſpeak of, and yet with that Courage and Alacrity, and with that Conſtancy, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Love, and the hope of good Succeſs do uſually bring forth in young men. And to ſhew how great this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration was of His Majeſty and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50300:90"/> the Princes affections and deſires to ſettle a ſure intereſt and correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with that Royal Houſe. I know not how to expreſs by any parallel on Earth, I muſt do it by looking up to a Tranſcendent in Heaven, whence the Father ſent his Son, and his Son gave himſelf for their love to Mankind.</p>
               <p>So at the firſt, the great Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put hereby upon all <hi>Spain,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and magnified, by their Oracle <hi>Conde d' Olivares;</hi> who in thankfulneſs concluded, it muſt needs be a Match; and that the two Kings of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> muſt part the world betwixt them: But this was the flouriſh of a mind which found it ſelf ſurprized, and was not yet reſolved in what mould to caſt it ſelf. For the very next day, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, he mixed a ſpecious welcome, with a great deal more ſtrangeneſs, and with a diſavowing of all that was paſt, &amp; ſpake of the match, as of a new thing; forgetting even the Laws of Hoſpitality and Honour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded an uncouth Condition to the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50300:90"/> Prince of changing his Religion; as if all former agreed Articles by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this honour done unto them, had been utterly diſanull'd. And when the Prince's brave conſtancy put them from this hold, then they caſt all upon the Popes Diſpenſation, which muſt be expected before any thing could be done. But in the mean time the Prince being in their power, what Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? what Jealouſies? what F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars were raiſed up? what Arts of Divines, what Councels, what Perſuaſions, and what Engines were uſed to batter a young, but well reſolved Heart, were too long to repeat. At length the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation came clogg'd both in matter and manner contrary to agreement, and new Conditions were alſo ſtood upon, either to draw the Prince, by accepting them, under their yoke, or by refuſing to make him the Author of the breach. Notwithſtanding by his care, wiſdom, and patience, and alſo with ſome reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſhew of Reſolution to depart unſatisfied; their expectation was gone beyond: and thereupon the Match
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50300:91"/> brought again to ſome tollerable terms tho' advantageous on their part, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſuch, as thereupon the ſending away o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the <hi>Infanta</hi> with the Prince, &amp; a Blank for the reſtoring the <hi>Palatinate</hi> were again promiſed and aſſured, if theſe Conditions might be ratified in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was all they now required Inſomuch that even in <hi>Spain,</hi> it was then believed, and much rejoyced at, that the Match was fully concluded on all parts. But it is to be noted, that this fair ſhew was made whilſt <hi>Mansfield<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi> and <hi>Brownſweek</hi> ſtood entire in the field, for after they were broken, tho' all was done in <hi>England</hi> according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, yet then they found it too late to ſend the <hi>Infanta</hi> till the <hi>Spring;</hi> they complained that their Rebels in the <hi>Low-Countryes</hi> were ſerved by our men; they required our aſſiſtance to reduce them to obedience; and the matter of Religion was meanly inſiſted on; ſo that now the Prince could not but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he was but juggled with, as himſelf has declared; and therefore he began to make way for his return,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50300:91"/> which was all the hope left him to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
